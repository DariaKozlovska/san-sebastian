                <h3>SAN SEBASTIAN</h3>
                <p>
                    Donostia - or San Sebastian - traces its history back to 1180, when Sancho the Strong (Sancho el Fuerte) founded the city in what is now the Old Quarter. The city’s unique geographic setting made it a perfect port and military stronghold, thus walls were built to surround the city and protect it from outside forces. Mount Urgull was converted into a fortress, equipped with artillery.
                    San Sebastian witnessed numerous wars and battles, was repeatedly looted and destroyed. But despite this, the locals did not lose heart and resolved to rebuild the city.
                    The city gained popularity when Queen Isabella II had been visited it since 1845. Her summer visits to the city were the as the start of what would become a resort town. The Spanish aristocracy followed suit and caused the city to flourish both economically and socially.
