                    <p>
                        Donostia - or San Sebastian - traces its history back to 1180, when Sancho the Strong (Sancho el Fuerte) founded the city in what is now the Old Quarter. The city’s unique geographic setting made it a perfect port and military stronghold, thus walls were built to surround the city and protect it from outside forces. Mount Urgull was converted into a fortress, equipped with artillery.
                        San Sebastian witnessed numerous wars and battles, was repeatedly looted and destroyed. But despite this, the locals did not lose heart and resolved to rebuild the city.
                        The city gained popularity when Queen Isabella II had been visited it since 1845. Her summer visits to the city were the as the start of what would become a resort town. The Spanish aristocracy followed suit and caused the city to flourish both economically and socially.

This beach is connecting with history and legends that go back up to 1800.

                                                    Old Town in San Sebastian is the second oldest neighbourhood in the city after Antiguo. It lies at the foot of Mount Urgull, protected by the sea on one side and the River Urumea on the other. Delving into the Old Town shows you the real social centre of San Sebastián. The Plaza de la Constitución, one of the most famous squares in the Gipuzkoa capital, also lies in this part of San Sebastián. It is brimming with life and takes a starring role in the best-known local festivals

                                                    El Peine del Viento (‘The Wind Comb’) is a collection of three steel sculptures each weighing over nine tonnes. These pieces have been positioned in the place where the city ends and the sea begins. This is a place where the wind and the sea beat together, whipping the rocks with a sense of abandon. Nature and art blend together and appear as one, and the positioning of the sculpture pieces makes them appear to emerge from the rocks themselves, almost as if they were a part of them.

Chillida Leku is a unique museum, made in itself as a great work of art. In it, the fusion between art and nature occurs in a natural way. The sculptures are integrated into the landscape as if they had always been part of it. In the garden, beech, oak and magnolios coexist with the monumental steel and granite sculptures located in perfect dialogue with the environment.

                                                    In the second fortnight in July, San Sebastián taps its feet to the rhythm of the finest jazz. Great musicians like James Brown, Liza Minnelli, Bobby McFerrin, Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson and B.B. King have all taken to the city’s beaches, theatres, squares and auditoriums at one time or another to delight audiences at this world-famous event.

                                                    In August and September San Sebastián hosts a hugely traditional classical music event: the Classical Music Fortnight. The Kursaal Centre, Santa María and San Vicente churches, the Victoria Eugenia Theatre and other stages throughout the city open their doors to fantastic international symphony orchestras and soloists. It is the oldest festival of its kind in Spain (on-going since 1939) and one of the longest running in Europe.
